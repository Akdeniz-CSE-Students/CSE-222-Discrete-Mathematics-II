In this assignment, you will create a brief content that you believe can be a part of this course and prepare slides that explains the content in latex. Use the attached template. Draw your graphs with the tikz package, do not use images (jpg, png, etc.) for graphs. To include code, use the minted package. The template contains examples for both.
Submit your tex file to this assignment with the name in this format StudentID-NameSurname.tex for example 20200808001-MehmetYildirim.tex
You are free about the content. The only criteria is that it must be about graphs. It can be a new idea, it can be a simple implementation of an idea in our slides, etc.
Grading criteria:
Relevance - How relevant the content is to graphs.
Originality - How original the content is. It must be something we didn't saw (exactly) in class. But it can be related of course. (Think of this as a complementary content for our course - previous manim hw was about the existing content, this one is about non-existing but related)
Complexity - Do not make it too simple. For example walk-trail definitions. But it doesn't have to be too complicated. For example difficulty of Dijkstra or even BFS/DFS suffices.
Quality - Quality of your slides - how well and explanatory the graph is drawn, the idea is explained, etc.

Estimated time and effort I am expecting (roughly):
1 hour for looking for an idea and understanding it
1 hour for designing the slide - what to draw and write
1 hour to produce the slide
